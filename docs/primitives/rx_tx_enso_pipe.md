# RX/TX Ensō Pipe

RX/TX Ensō Pipes are designed for applications that modify received data inline and then send it back to the NIC without the need to impose copy overhead. They can be seen as a combination of the [RX](rx_enso_pipe.md) and [TX](tx_enso_pipe.md) Ensō Pipes, containing a subset of their functionality.
