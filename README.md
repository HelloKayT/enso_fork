### File description:
- input_gen: convert .pcap file to .pkt, which is the input for RTL simulation.
- src: RTL source code.
- src/common: common building block generated by Quartus IP, like FIFOs, BRAMs, Mux.
- expected_res.txt: expected RTL simulation output for Dummy test.
- modelsim.ini: specify the path to Quartus compiled sim_lib. 
- run_vsim_afs.sh: run RTL simulation. 

### Steps:
1. Download the sim_lib, unzip it in AFS domain. Change the path in modelsim.ini to link the downloaded sim_lib. 
2. Make sure the Modelsim can be invoked from AFS. 
3. Go to input_gen, generate the input for RTL simulation. And then run the simulation. The printout should match the expected_res.txt if you don't change anything
```
cd input_gen
./run.sh m10_100.pcap
mv output.pkt m10_100.pkt
cd ..
./run_vsim_afs.sh
```
### SRC description:
- my_struct_s.sv is the header file that specify most of the parameters and structs. 
- tb.sv is the testbench. You should specify new .pkt file in this file and number of line of new .pkt.
```
localparam hi = X; //X is number of lines in new .pkt file
...
$readmemh("./input_gen/m10_100.pkt", arr, lo, hi); //change to new .pkt file
```
  - top.sv is the top level module of core logic. Various counters are used to monitor the correctness of the datapath.
    - input_comp.sv: Store input pkt to Global Pkt Buffer, update emptylist, extract header to Parser
    - parser.sv: Take the header flit, fill in the metadata fields, pass the metadata to Flow Director
    - flow_director_wrapper.sv: Wrapper file for flow_director. Currently directly forward the metadata
    - basic_data_mover.sv: Take the metadata from Flow Director and then fetch pkt from Global Pkt Buffer, then (1) forward the pkt to Ethernet output, or (2) drop pkt, or (3) send to PCIe, depending on the pkt_flag field.
    - pdu_gen.sv: Take the metadata from basic_data_mover and pkts data to form a block for PCIe transmission. 
  - esram_wrapper.sv: Global Pkt Buffer. In simulation, it is a BRAM to speed up simulation. During Synthesis, it is mapped to eSRAM. The `define SIM` should be commented during Synthesis. 
  - pcie_top.sv : PCIe top-level. Dummy module when `SIM` is defined. 
    - fpga2cpu_pcie.sv : Handle the FPGA->CPU transfer. FPGA side pushes data to ring buffer. The other side of the ring buffer will fetch data in batch and starts DMA to CPU.
      - ring_buffer.sv: The ring_buffer at FPGA side. 
  - my_stats.sv: Performance monitor to monitor the throughput of RX and TX of Ethernet core. Also able to track the latency spent of our design.  

### Note:
1. \*.ini, \*.pcap, \*.pkt are ingored in .gitignore. You should change your local .ini file and you can add new pcap/pkt in your local copy. But please do not upload to this repo.
2. In input_gen, you can change the run.sh to capture different number of pkts from the pcap. Usually start with small number.
3. run_vsim_afs.sh allow you choose GUI mode, CMD mode, and optimized CMD mode. GUI mode is great for debugging using waveform. CMD mode is good for getting the results quickly. Optimized CMD applied internal optimizations which may affect the results.
